The Sea Change Program on Zen Habits
=========

What is this? It's a way for members to submit problems, questions, suggestions for improvements, or other issues with the Sea Change Program.

How do you submit an issue?

1. Go to the [issues tab](https://github.com/sea-change/seachange/issues).
2. Hit the "New Issue" green button.
3. Type a title and a comment (questions, problem, issue, suggestion, etc.).
4. Optionally, add a label to the right. This is helpful.
5. Be sure to hit the "Submit new issue" green button when you're done.

Notes:

* I can't guarantee we'll get to every problem or issue, but we'll do our best.
* These are public. Please don't provide personal information you would be unhappy with the world seeing. Definitely don't provide credit card or password info.
